# ES2020 Features

* As of now we can use babel transpiler to use these features.

* We can also tryout their usage in MDN website links opened in supported browsers (Ex: Chrome 79 or later supports optional chaining).

* To check from which versions of browsers a particular feature is supported, use the website [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/)
  * [Private class fields usage](https://caniuse.com/#search=private%20class%20fields)
  * [Optional chaining](https://caniuse.com/#search=optional%20chaining)
  * [Static methods and class fields](https://caniuse.com/#search=static%20class)

## Null safety or short circuiting OR (Existing one)

* Ternary operator and logical OR already exists in javascript.

* Helps to guard against null values and provide default values

* The first operand is used only when the first operand evaluates to `true`

```javascript
// consider the below statement
let res = val ? val : '*'

// The above statement can also be written as
let res = val || '*'
```

## [Null coalescing operator (`??`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator)

* Binary assignment operator.

* If the first operand is `null` or `undefined`, then `??` will use the second operand

```javascript
console.log(null ?? 'Hello');
console.log(undefined ?? 'Hello');

// below statement explains the functionality of the null coalescing operator
let res = (val !== undefined || val !== null ) ? '*' : val;

let res = val ?? '*'

// prints 0 since this operator looks for null or undefined
// as the first operand to resort to the second operand
const baz = 0 ?? 42;
console.log(baz);
```

## [Optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)

> The optional chaining operator ?. permits reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid. The ?. operator functions similarly to the . chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (null or undefined), the expression short-circuits with a return value of undefined. When used with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does not exist.

```javascript
obj?.prop
obj?.[expr]
arr?.[index]
func?.(args)
```

* When object reference is `null` or `undefined` in the chain, the chain is short circuited returning `undefined` instead or raising error.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  home: {
    contact: '12345'
  }
};

// using optional chaining
console.log(person.home?.contact);
console.log(person.work?.contact);

// without using optional chaining
console.log(person.home.contact);

// ERROR: Cannot read property 'contact' of undefined
console.log(person.work.contact);
```

* This can also be used to safely check and invoke methods on the object.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  home: {
    contact: '12345'
  },
  info: function() {
    return `contact ${this.name} at ${this.home.contact}`;
  }
};

console.log(person.info?.());

// returns undefined instead of throwing error
console.log(person.greeting?.());
```

* The real power of this feature comes when we are working with large nested objects to not get overwhelmed by the complexity, we can save ourselves with this:

```javascript
  console.log(lang?.en?.words?.rudeWords?.['a bad word'])
```
